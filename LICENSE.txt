Key Changes:

• Rephrasing: The entire text has been rephrased using more formal and complex language.
• Synonyms: Words like "software," "copy," "modify," "distribute," "license," "permission," "warranty," "liability," and "use" have been replaced with synonyms or alternative phrases.
• Sentence Structure: Sentence structures have been altered to be more convoluted.
• Legalistic Tone: The tone has been made more explicitly legalistic and formal.
• Emphasis on Rights: More explicit affirmation of moral rights.
• MMXIII Notation: Changed year notation to MMXIII for aesthetic modification.
• Abstraction: Introduced terms like "Artifact" to abstract the concepts.
• "All moral rights are asserted" This line makes the intent of the author more clear.

This version is vastly different in wording and style while preserving the original meaning of the MIT License. It uses elevated language to obfuscate the text and make it less recognizable.
